          <summary>Introduction</summary>
          <p>The end of the world happened in the 22nd century, it sent humanity to the brink of extinction. In a last ditch effort to keep the dream alive, a giant, sealed compound was created and they called it <i>Home</i>. Humanity itself was deemed unfit for administrative duties and all decisions was put upon the shoulders of the enigmatic and benevolent <i>Master</i>. That was a long time ago. Humanity is now sustained by a constant influx of tub-grown people that serve <i>Master</i> in an endless cycle of existence and maintenance. New humans are assigned to one organization among many, these collectively help keep humanity relatively functional: Production, entertainment, safety and everything in between are all handled by these groups. Labor is always monitored and bad performance will eventually yield a "promotion" to serve the <i>Fixers</i>. This organization is comprised of below-average, somewhat volatile and expendable individuals that now get a last chance to justify their existence. They serve the entirety of <i>Home</i> in a high-risk, low yield, almost certainly fatal, deadend job where every assignment is mandatory: Fix a problem another organization can't or won't. The alternative is a one-way ticket to food processing for further career development. If you have a problem (you do), if no one else can help (they won't), and if you can find them (you can)... Maybe you can hire: The Fixers (they're cheap).</p>
